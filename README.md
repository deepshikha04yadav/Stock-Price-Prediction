# Stock-Price-Prediction
This project aims to predict stock prices using historical data and machine learning techniques. It leverages time series analysis to forecast future stock prices, providing insights that could be valuable for investors and analysts.

# üìñ Overview
The core of this project is a Jupyter Notebook titled Stock Price Prediction.ipynb, which contains the implementation of the stock price prediction model. The notebook includes:
* Data preprocessing steps

* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

* Model training and evaluation

* Visualization of predictions

# üöÄ Features
* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling, and formatting data for modeling.

* Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing trends and patterns in stock price data.

* Modeling: Implementing machine learning models suitable for time series forecasting.

* Evaluation: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.

* Visualization: Plotting actual vs. predicted stock prices for comparison.

# üíª Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   * git clone https://github.com/deepshikha04yadav/Stock-Price-Prediction.git
   * cd Stock-Price-Prediction
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   * python -m venv venv
   * source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install the required packages:
   * pip install -r requirements.txt
*Note: If requirements.txt is not provided, you'll need to install packages manually based on the notebook's imports.

# üìä Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

2. Navigate to Stock Price Prediction.ipynb and open it.

3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the data processing, modeling, and prediction steps.

Ensure that you have the necessary stock price data available or modify the data loading section of the notebook to fetch the required dataset.
